🚀 Project Title: Data-Pilot
🔍 Overview
Data-Pilot is a versatile and interactive data analytics engine that simplifies the journey from raw data to actionable insights. Built to streamline and automate the most essential tasks in the data science lifecycle—Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and insightful report generation—this toolkit provides users with a hands-on, no-fuss experience.
Whether you're a data scientist seeking a rapid prototype environment or a beginner looking to experiment with real-world modeling, Data-Pilot empowers users to dive deep into structured datasets through a clean, modular workflow. Users can explore insights from a bundled default dataset or upload their own CSV file and immediately visualize, analyze, and model their data—with no need to write a single line of code.
